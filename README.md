# Systolic Array Project
## Main Idea and High-Level Project Overview

This project is based on the idea that large language models are good at generating code in popular high-level languages
such as Python. Large language models are comparatively bad at generating code in languages that describe hardware such 
as Verilog. Therefore this project leverages Amaranth, a Python hardware description language that can generate Verilog
to quickly and efficiently generate a hardware systolic array design, simulate the design, test the design, and finally produce the verilog for the design to connect to the Caravel wishbone and hardend. We used GitHub Copilot for this project because it was able to use the Amaranth files generated from the previous project in this line of work: https://github.com/JamesTimothyMeech/RNG. We committed the single original unedited conversation with GitHub Copilot. We then edited the file to improve the format for readability. This is a more advanced parameterizable systolic array project built using the same method as: https://github.com/JamesTimothyMeech/RNG The systolic array is a significantly more advanced design than the random number generator. The reader should not that despite the fact that this design is significantly more complicated than the previous random number generator design, GitHub Copilot was able to generate a working design in a single conversation instead of the six conversation required for Microsoft Bing Chat to successfully generate a working random number generator design that met the specification.
