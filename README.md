# Systolic Array Project

This is a more advanced parameterizable systolic array project built using the same method as: https://github.com/JamesTimothyMeech/RNG The systolic array is a significantly more advanced design than the random number generator. We used GitHub Copilot with the random number generator design files open as reference to produce this design in a single GitHub Copilot chat session. The chat log and Amaranth Python script used to generate the systolic array are avaliable in the repository. I will add futher documentation in the coming days.
